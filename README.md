<b>The Most Inspirational Quote by the Inspiration Himself - now written in Java</b>

#What's in the code?
- Recursive function of DJ Khaled saying "Another one" to boost your motivation.
- Audio playback with sun.audio
- Threads included 
- "Another one" is played every 2050 milliseconds
- Try and catch statements are used, because the Java VM don't want you to win. Java VM don't want you to get repeatedly inspired. Java VM don't want you to grow out of inspiration. Java VM intends to use exceptions so that one day you will play yourself.

#Q & A Session

<b>Question:</b> Audio just can't be played. Classes like AudioPlayer isn't working, and it also suggests that AudioStream is not an API, hence the Access Restriction error. What does this mean?
<b>Answer:</b> Solution is here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26766492/access-restriction-to-audio. As for other IDEs other than Eclipse, you essentially should allow access of deprecated and restricted APIs.

<b>Question:</b> Why recursion? You could've just execute the methods in an infinite while loop instead.
<b>Answer:</b> A lecturer of mine said that recursion is the key to success. The man himself also said, "When you stop making excuses and you work hard and go hard you will be very successful." I want to be successful. Therefore, I'm going hard with recursion.

<b>Question:</b> Why Java of all languages?
<b>Answer:</b> I believe that it is important to be number one. DJ Khaled lived life to the fullest when his record became number one in the country. Therefore, I picked the number one language as suggested by some of these programming language indexes.

<b>Question:</b> I see threads? Why?
<b>Answer:</b> Because why the heck not? Even if the use of that yields no huge difference in real world results, I just feel like using them for the fun of it.

<b>Question:</b> What on earth drove you to make this s***?
<b>Answer:</b> I'm just feeling inspired, nothing more.

<b>Question:</b> I'm feeling dumb now. How to be smart?
<b>Answer:</b> Who's your inspiration?
